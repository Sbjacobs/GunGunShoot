* Everyone starts with zero bullets. This is to weed out the people who arenâ€™t paying attention to the rules. The logical first move of every game is to Reload.
* The objective is to shoot the opponent while they are vulnerable.
    * **If you shoot with no bullets, you are vulnerable.** 
    * **If your shield has taken too much damage, you are vulnerable.**
